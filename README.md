## Anomaly Detection Pipeline for Electrocardiograms (ECG)

### Overview
This repository contains an anomaly detection pipeline designed to identify anomalies in electrocardiograms (ECGs) using deep learning techniques with TensorFlow. The pipeline is built upon the ECG5000 dataset, which includes both normal and abnormal ECG readings.

### Purpose
The primary objective of this pipeline is to leverage neural networks to learn the distinguishing features of normal ECG patterns and subsequently detect deviations indicative of abnormalities. By deconstructing and reconstructing ECG signals, the neural network can discern anomalies based on the magnitude of reconstruction error exceeding a predefined threshold. This capability has significant potential in healthcare settings, allowing for timely alerts or notifications to medical staff when irregular heart rhythms are detected.

### Key Components
1. **Dataset**: The ECG5000 dataset, comprising normal and abnormal ECG recordings, serves as the foundational data for training and evaluation.
   
2. **Deep Learning Model**: TensorFlow is utilized to construct and train neural networks capable of learning complex patterns in ECG signals.

3. **Anomaly Detection Mechanism**: The pipeline incorporates a mechanism to determine anomalies by comparing the reconstruction error of ECG signals against a predefined threshold learned during training on normal ECGs.

### How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Raw ECG data is preprocessed to prepare it for input into the neural network.
   
2. **Model Training**: The neural network is trained on a dataset consisting of normal ECG signals to learn the characteristic features of healthy heart rhythms.
   
3. **Anomaly Detection**: During inference, the trained model reconstructs input ECG signals and computes the reconstruction error. An anomaly is flagged when the error exceeds the predetermined threshold.

### Applications
- **Healthcare Monitoring**: The pipeline can be deployed in healthcare settings to continuously monitor ECG signals, providing early detection of abnormal heart rhythms and triggering alerts for medical intervention.

- **Training applications**: Various apps in excercise and health can leverage this pipeline to detect abnormalities in heartrate to provide a safe and protecting training application.
   
- **Research and Development**: Researchers can utilize this pipeline to explore novel approaches for anomaly detection in ECG data, contributing to advancements in cardiac health monitoring technology.
